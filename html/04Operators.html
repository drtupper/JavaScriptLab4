    <h1>Page 4: Operators</h1>
  <p>Operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.</p> 
    <p>JavaScript has ten different operators:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>+</strong> is the addition operator</li>
        <li><strong>-</strong> is the subtraction operator</li>
        <li><strong>=</strong> is the assignment operator</li>
        <li><strong>*</strong> is the multiplication operator</li>
        <li><strong>/</strong> is the division operator</li>
        <li><strong>%</strong> is the modulus (calculate remainder) operator</li>
        <li><strong>>, <, and ==</strong> are comparison operators</li>
        <li><strong>**</strong> is the exponentiation operator</li>
        <li><strong>++</strong> is the increment operator</li>
        <li><strong>--</strong> is the decrement operator</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>There are also combination operators such as +=, *=, etc., but we will learn those after we learn about variables.</p>
